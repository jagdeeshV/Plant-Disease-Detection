Plant Disease Detection from uploaded leaf images
</h1>
[ Python Project - Data set training, CNN architecture & training techniques,  Streamlit, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras and PyTorch. ]

### Project Objective


Develop an end-to-end comprehensive system that enables users to upload leaf image and accurately detect and classify the leaf status what leaf, whether healthy or dieseased with type of disease present using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

This project aims to design, develop, implement, and optimize a complete solution that integrates machine learning, computer vision, and streamlit user interface.

Real-World Relevance: Address practical applications in agriculture, providing a tool that helps farmers or gardeners quickly diagnose plant diseases and take appropriate actions.

### Approach

 An End-to-End Development: Right from setting up the image upload interface to training the CNN model and delivering a polished, user-friendly application.
  1.	**Train and fine-tune** a CNN model using New Plant Diseases Dataset from the Kaggle.   
	 •  Evaluate the model’s performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
	 •  Experiment with different CNN architectures and training techniques to maximize the model’s accuracy.
	 • Implementoptimizations to ensure the system runs efficiently and delivers results in real-time.    	

  2. ***User Interface:***. 
	 • Designed a Streamlit application that validates and accepts user's uploaded leaf images and predicts the plant name, disease if any the leaf is affected with.

### Technologies used and Pre-requisites


1.	** Python: ** The programming language used for building the application and scripting tasks.

    Visit the URL  [Download Python | Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)    to download and install python in the PC

    **Install necessary Python packages / Libraries:** Install the necessary frameworks / libraries using pip or conda package manager. Required libraries include Streamlit, Pandas,  OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch

2.	**Streamlit:** Streamlit is an open-source Python framework designed to create and share web applications. It is specifically built for Python, making it easy for data scientists and machine learning engineers to deploy their models and visualize data without needing extensive knowledge of web development.
	
        Web-based user interface/s developed using Streamlit for face emotion Prediction.

### Executing the Application 

To run the project, follow these steps:

1.	Install Python and required Framework / libraries as given above
2.	Download the Python Applications from my Git hub repositary.
5.	Launch the Application through Windows command / Powershell typing.  
     **streamlit run Jag_Detect_Leaf_disease.py** for uploading image to predict
